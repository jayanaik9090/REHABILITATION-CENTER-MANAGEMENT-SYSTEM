# REHABILITATION-CENTER-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
DBMS_mini_project about REHABILITATION-CENTER-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM

Substance addiction is a widely recognized problem that has affected a large audience. A
rehabilitation center is a place where an individual undergoes treatment and recovers from this
addiction. The rehabilitation center management system gives us the daily internal routine and
services that take place in this center. The services like registration of an individual into the
facility, scheduling and rescheduling of appointments and termination of the treatment process
are provided. The project shows how the treatment process and the detoxification programs
are scheduled together with the counseling and therapy sessions. Depending on the urgency
and the severity of the condition of the individual, the detoxification programsâ€™ duration is
determined. The schedules of narcotics meetings, personal and family counseling, group
therapy have to be integrated seamlessly with the recovery process. This project gives us an
insight into how the database is updated in order to meet the needs of the users.
